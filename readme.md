## Features

- **Password-Based Authentication:** Secure password storage with hashing.
- **OTP Verification:** Send OTPs via SMS or email using cloud services.
- **Authenticator App Support:** Integrate with apps like Google Authenticator.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Optional biometric factor for enhanced security.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of users and requests.
- **Secure API:** HTTPS, rate limiting, and logging for secure communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, or Angular
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/Django), Java (Spring Boot)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
- **Libraries:**
  - Password Hashing: bcrypt
  - OTP Generation: `pyotp`, `otp` for Node.js
  - QR Code: `qrcode` for Node.js

## Architecture

The system is built on a client-server architecture using microservices for authentication factors. It consists of the following components:

- **Frontend Application:** User interface for login and MFA setup.
- **Backend API:** RESTful API for authentication and verification.
- **Database:** Stores user credentials, MFA settings, and tokens.
- **Cloud Services:** Integrate with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for SMS/Email services and scalability.
